My name is **John Antwi**.

This site documents my work for **LA5880**, including GIS exercises, assignments, and a final project.

I am currently a Graduate Student at the Iowa State University at the Iowa State University in the Urban Planning and Development Programme. My Research interest is in Building Sustainable and Resilient Urban areas to enhance the well being of the people and to promote economic growth. I love football and Lionel Messi is my favorite football player.
